How I simply integrate a Node module into Wakanda!===================Thanks to the new feature **NodeWorker** developed by **Wakanda** teams, it becomes now possible to have full benefit of any **Node package module** into a **Wakanda** application.----------npm into wakanda-------------Letâ€™s think about a situation where we need to use a **Node** module in a **Wakanda** backend project. For example, in my **Wakanda** application I need to check the code of a visa credit card passed into a url as a query string to check if it is valid or not.To check the visa code, we will use a node package module called **visa-validation**, this **npm** is able to check the credit card number validity, the expiration date and also the cvv validity.#### <i class="icon-link"></i> Create the request handlerAfter creating a backend project, we will create a requesthandler that will call the function responsible for creating the node worker. Into **bootstrap.js** we will add this line of code:```javascripthttpServer.addRequestHandler('/verify-visa', 'handler.js', 'check')```#### <i class="icon-file"></i> Create a handlerThen we will need to add a file called **handler.js** that will contain the function ```check()``` which will be responsible for creating a **nodeWoker** where we will require the **visa-validation module**.```javascriptvar check = function(req, res){	var myWorker = new NodeWorker( './node-worker.js', 'my-worker');	var result;	var query = req.urlQuery;	var query = query.substr(5);	myWorker.port.postMessage(query);	myWorker.port.onmessage = function(event){		result = event.data;		}	wait(1000);	if(result === true)			return 'The result is ' + result +', your visa credit card is valid'	if(result === false) 		return 'The result is ' + result +', your visa credit card is not valid'}```#### <i class="icon-credit-card"></i> Create the node worker of visa validationWe will need to install the node module into the backend folder. So in our terminal we will have to insert those commands> cd backend>  npm init>  npm install visa-validation &mdash;&mdash;saveAnd here is the code defining how the **Node module** will be required into the file **node-worker.js**.```javascriptvar visaCard = requireNode('visa-validation');onconnect = function(connectEvent) {    var workerPort = connectEvent.ports[0];        workerPort.onmessage = function(event){    	var validation = visaCard.isValidCardNumber(event.data);    	workerPort.postMessage( validation );		close();    }}```#### <i class="icon-check"></i> How it works?![Alt text](/assets/nodeWorkerProcess.png?raw=true "node worker")When the request handler is called through the browser via this link:```http://127.0.0.1:8081/verify-visa?code=4916396764746993```That means that the function ```check(req, res)``` contained into **handler.js** is called automatically and it will instantiate the node worker present on the **node-worker.js**.```var myWorker = new NodeWorker( './node-worker.js', 'my-worker');```Then it will get the parameter on the query string, so it can post it to the node worker ```myWorker.port.postMessage(query);```On the other side, when the **node worker** is created it waits for an event from the **handler**. When it receive the message that it waits for, it post a response containing the result of the **visa-validation node module** and finally close the **node worker**.```javascriptworkerPort.onmessage = function(event){    	var validation = visaCard.isValidCardNumber(event.data);    	workerPort.postMessage( validation );		close();   }```We should also not forget to add a ```wait()``` in **handler.js** so it can be able to receive the response from the **node worker** before its context is killed. At the end, the ```check()``` function will return the **node worker** response as a result, so it can display it on the browser.
